* What is it?

Emacslisten doesn't do much yet, but the idea is, eventually, a fully free
software driven voice-to-text/code system for emacs using the super awesome
[[http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/][CMU Sphinx]] system, and d-bus.  (Other transports may eventually be supported.)

More behind the idea in my [[http://dustycloud.org/blog/emacslisten/][original blogpost]]! :)

* How do I use it?

Not much to see yet.  However, this does work:

: ./python listen_daemon.py

Which will start up a gui.

Then:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(load-file "~/path/to/emacslisten/emacslisten.el")
#+END_SRC

Press the speak button in the GUI... it should appear, likewise, in the emacs
mode line.
